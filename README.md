# Dinotifier

This was a personal project and it was my first time monkeying around with hardware. I built an Arduino-based notification system that spins a dinosaur, which was glued to a motor, when it detects a Slack message.

It uses Johnny-Five Javascript robotics framework and Node.js for the server and the Slack API to detect new messages in real-time.
